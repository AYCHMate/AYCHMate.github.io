excerpt: Cyberduck is a libre FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, S3, Backblaze B2, Azure & OpenStack Swift browser for Mac and Windows. All vaults either created by Cyberduck or Cryptomator are fully interoperable.

Cyberduck supports client-side encryption with â€‹Cryptomator interoperable vaults to secure your data on any server or cloud storage. Cyberduck is open source software, so the same principles of Cryptomator apply to Cyberduck as well. Anyone is able to check the code. It is impossible to introduce backdoors for third parties. Also you cannot hide vulnerabilities. And the best thing is: There is no need to trust the software producer, as you can control them!

This cooperation is very exciting for us because it gives you a new way to access your vaults. Cryptomator was designed to only perform the en- and decryption without the actual cloud synchronization. This means your cloud storage files had to be accessible via the filesystem. You either had to install a sync client of the cloud storage providers or mount a network drive.

Cyberduck lets you browse your cloud storage without the need of additional sync clients or remote connections via the filesystem. It comes with its own file browser and the cloud storage files are loaded on-demand.
