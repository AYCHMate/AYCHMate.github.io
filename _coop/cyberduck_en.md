Cyberduck supports client-side encryption with â€‹Cryptomator interoperable vaults to secure your data on any server or cloud storage. Cyberduck is open source software, so the same principles of Cryptomator apply to Cyberduck as well. Anyone is able to check the code. It is impossible to introduce backdoors for third parties. Also you cannot hide vulnerabilities. And the best thing is: There is no need to trust the software producer, as you can control them!
