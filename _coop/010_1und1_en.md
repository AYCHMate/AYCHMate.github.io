Encryption is done using a unique, individual key. The files are converted into an unreadable sequence of characters. Only with this key, the files can be made readable again.

As a provider, 1&1 already guarantees the end-to-end SSL encryption of the files during transmission, the exclusive storage of the files in secure data centers in Germany, and compliance with strict data protection laws. End-to-end encryption by 1&1 Verschl端sselung complements this security concept with an additional component for the protection of privacy.
