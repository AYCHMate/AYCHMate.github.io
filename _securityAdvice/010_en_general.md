<p class="lead">Below we present some recommendations on secure usage of Cryptomator.</p>

Some general advice:

- Always install the latest software- and system-updates.
- Always use an up to date browser. Only use required plugins and keep them updated.
- Only use programs from trusted sources.
- Do not open email attachments or links without consideration. Do not open suspicious emails.
- Always lock your device when you no longer use it or leave it alone.

Advice regarding mobile devices:

- Check the permissions an app requires. Do not use apps, which request permissions that are not required to perform the provided functionality. E.g. a flashlight app does not need access to your adress book. If possible, only grant permissions which are obviously required.
- Protect your device at least with a PIN lock, better with a password.
- Check if encrypting your device is an option.
