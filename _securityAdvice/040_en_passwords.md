<p class="lead">Bad passwords can be cracked easily when using computers.</p>

Thus for secure passwords there exist plenty of recommendations. Some of those are:

- A password should not contain public or personal information like names of your pets, date of birht or username.
- A password should be long.
- A password should not be an existing word or a combination of few words. It should be a combination of characters or words that is as random as possible.
- For each purpose a unique password without similarity to other passwords should be used.

If you fulfill those requirements, you quickly reach a point where remembering the passwords gets impossible. Thus we recommend to use a password manager to generate and store the passwords. By doing so you only have to remember a few or a single secure password.
