<p class="lead">Below we present some recommendations on secure usage of Cryptomator.</p>

Some general advice:

- Always install the latest software and system updates.
- Always use an up-to-date browser. Only use required plug-ins and keep them updated.
- Only use programs from trusted sources.
- Do not open email attachments or links without consideration. Do not open suspicious emails.
- Always lock your device when you no longer use it or leave it unattended.

Further advice on mobile devices:

- Check the permissions an app requires. Do not use apps which request permissions that are not required to perform the provided functionality. E.g., a flashlight app does not need access to your contacts. If possible, only grant permissions which are obviously required.
- Protect your device at least with a PIN lock, better with a password.
- Check if encrypting your device is an option.
