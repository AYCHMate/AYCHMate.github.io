<p class="lead">Bad passwords can be cracked easily when using computers.</p>

There exist plenty of recommendations for secure passwords. Some of these are:

- A password should not contain public or personal information like name of your pet, date of birth, or username.
- A password should be long.
- A password should not be an existing word or a combination of a few words. It should be a combination of characters or words that are as random as possible.
- For each purpose a unique password without similarity to other passwords should be used.

If you fulfill these requirements, you quickly reach a point where remembering the passwords gets impossible. Thus, we recommend to use a password manager to generate and store the passwords. By doing so, you only have to remember a few or a single secure password.
