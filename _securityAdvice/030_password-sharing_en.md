<p class="lead">Always be careful when sharing your vault with other people.</p>

In general, keep your vault password secret. Nobody except youself should know the vault password. Only when you use a vault together with other people, they may know your vault password. Keep in mind that other people could pass on – with or without intent – the vault password. Only share your vaults with people you trust.

If you share a vault with others, do not communicate the vault password on an insecure channel. Tell the password in person, use encrypted email, or other similar secure means.
