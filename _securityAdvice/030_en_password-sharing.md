<p class="lead">Always be careful when sharing your vault with other people.</p>

In general, keep your vault password secret. Nobody except youself should know the vault password. Only when you use a vault together with other people they may know your vault password. Keep in mind, that other people could pass on - with or without intent - the vault password. So only share your vaults with people your trust in this sense.

If you share a vault with others do never communicate the vault password on an insecure channel. Tell the password people in person or use encrypted email or other similar secure means.
