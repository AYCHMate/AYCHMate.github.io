# Privacy Policy

## Privacy
The operator of this website takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the data protection regulations and this privacy policy.

The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. As far as on our sides personal data (for example name, address or e-mail addresses) are collected, this takes place, as far as possible, on voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your explicit consent.

We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.

## Cookies
Some of these pages use so-called cookies. Cookies do not cause any damage to your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies serve to make our website more user-friendly, effective and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.

Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies". They are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognize your browser the next time you visit our website.

You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or generally and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. When cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be limited.

## Server log files
The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:

- the browser type and browser version
- the operating system used
- the referrer URL
- the host name of the accessing computer
- the time of the server request

This data cannot be assigned to specific persons. This data is not combined with other data sources. We reserve the right to check the data subsequently if we become aware of concrete indications of an illegal use.

## Newsletter
If you would like to subscribe to the newsletter offered on the website, we require an e-mail address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided and that you agree to receive the newsletter. Further data will not be collected. We use this data exclusively for the dispatch of the requested information and do not pass them on to third parties.

You can revoke your consent to the storage of the data, the e-mail address and its use for sending the newsletter at any time, for example via the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter.

## Commenting function on this site
For the comment function on this page, in addition to your comment, information about the time the comment was created, your e-mail address and, if you do not post anonymously, your chosen user name will be saved.

**Storage of the IP address**

Our comment function stores the IP addresses of users who write comments. Since we do not check comments on our site before they are activated, we need this data in order to be able to take action against the author in the event of legal infringements such as insults or propaganda.

**Subscription to comments**

As a user of the site, you can subscribe to comments after registering. You will receive a confirmation email to check if you are the owner of the given email address. You can cancel this function at any time via a link in the info mails.

## SSL encryption
This site uses SSL encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as requests you send to us as a site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.

If SSL encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

## Right to information, deletion and blocking
You have the right to free-of-charge information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients and the purpose of data processing as well as a right to correction, blocking or deletion of this data at any time. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the Impressum if you have any further questions on the subject of personal data.

## Opposition to advertisting e-mails
We object to the use of contact data published within the scope of the Impressum obligation to send unrequested advertising and information material. The operators of these pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited advertising information, such as spam e-mails.
