## What's New
Introducing Dokany (Windows) and FUSE (macOS, Linux) support. Vaults can now be mounted via Dokany and FUSE which is now the preferred way over WebDAV. Expect vastly improved integration into the system. A complete list of closed issues is available [here](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/milestone/27?closed=1){:target="_blank"}.

## Dokany / FUSE
- Provide virtual drive using Dokany on Windows ([#207](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/207){:target="_blank"})
- Provide virtual drive using FUSE on macOS and Linux ([#252](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/252){:target="_blank"})
- Solves upstream bug with keeping modification date and other dates of original file ([#220](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/220){:target="_blank"})
- Solves upstream bug on Windows with files >4 GB ([#82](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/82){:target="_blank"})
- Solves upstream bug on Windows with Windows Explorer showing C: drive capacity for any vault ([#80](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/80){:target="_blank"})
- Solves upstream bug on macOS High Sierra with disappearing drives ([#579](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/579){:target="_blank"})
