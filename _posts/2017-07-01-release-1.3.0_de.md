We've completely rewritten Cryptomator. Its core components are now modularized to <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib" target="_blank">CryptoLib</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs" target="_blank">CryptoFS</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/webdav-nio-adapter" target="_blank">WebDAV-NIO-Adapter</a>. A complete list of closed issues is available <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/milestone/26?closed=1" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Improvements
- Auto-Unlock!!! :tada: (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/40" target="_blank">#40</a>) We finally implemented the most-wished feature. Still experimental and will be completed by autostart (optionally hidden) in future versions
- New vault format 6 (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/521" target="_blank">#521</a>)
- Added new options to "unlocked" screen: Mount/unmount without locking/unlocking (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/452" target="_blank">#452</a>)
- Network access now filtered by the socket instead of the application (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/431" target="_blank">#431</a>)
- You can now change the socket port without restarting Cryptomator
- New log system with log file rotation and exposed, user-adjustable configuration

#### Windows
- Removed IPv6 flag, Windows will now always mount `cryptomator-vault` which is mapped to `127.0.0.1` (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/512" target="_blank">#512</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/529" target="_blank">#529</a>)

#### macOS
- Improved macOS Sierra integration, unlocking doesn't ask for username/password for `localhost` anymore (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/170" target="_blank">#170</a>)
- Improved iCloud Drive compatibility (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/364" target="_blank">#364</a>)
- Fixed slow startup on some systems
- Added `CMD+,` shortcut for preferences

### Misc
- Changed license to GPLv3
- Dropped SHA-1 signatures in Windows Authenticode code signing
- Dropped official Windows Vista support
- Dropped official Ubuntu Vivid and Wily support

### Technical Details on Windows Mounting
After we have fixed <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/431" target="_blank">#431</a>, we noticed various issues on Windows. We tried hosting the virtual drive via `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `::1` but every host has its own issue: Sometimes access to the virtual drive was extremely slow, sometimes Windows showed unnecessary security warnings (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/529" target="_blank">#529</a>), and sometimes Office didn't properly work (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/512" target="_blank">#512</a>). That's why the Windows installer for Cryptomator now writes the new host `cryptomator-vault` (which is mapped to `127.0.0.1`) into the `hosts` file. Weirdly enough, with that new host, all problems seem to be gone. Even though we don't quite understand why binding an IP has such a big impact, we just hope that we finally found a good solution!

### Under-The-Hood Improvements
We'd like to highlight some improvements that we were able to make under-the-hood: Faster build times, high test coverage for our crypto libraries, and more!
