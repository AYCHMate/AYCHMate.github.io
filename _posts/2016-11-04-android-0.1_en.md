We've finally released the first beta version of Cryptomator for Android after almost 6 months of development. It's a completely new and native app. In this process, we outsourced the cryptographic code from our main project, which is now available as <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib" target="_blank">CryptoLib</a>.

You're welcome to test the beta version. Follow <a href="/android" target="_blank">this link</a> for more information. Version 0.1 is by far not feature-complete and has known issues, but we're of course open for feature requests, suggestions, and obviously bug reports.

You can send us feedback on <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-android" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. We've created a repository just for collecting Android issues. Please review and follow our <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">contribution guidelines</a>.

Thank you all for your patience! We know some of you have been already waiting for an Android app of Cryptomator for many months. We're looking forward to your feedback! :smile:

## What's next?
- Version 0.2: We're going to fix some critical/major bugs first, don't expect too many new features.
- After that we'll most likely successively add support for Google Drive, OneDrive, and WebDAV.
- Our goal is to add the functionality equal to the iOS app for the final version.
