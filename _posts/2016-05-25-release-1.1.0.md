### What's New:
- Password Strength Indicator: Based on Dropbox's <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/" target="_blank">zxcvbn</a>. Kudos to Jean-NoÃ«l Charon (jncharon on GitHub) for implementing this feature.
- Sync Conflict Resolution: When editing a file on multiple devices simultaneously, version conflicts are inevitable. Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. can detect these conflicts and will provide all versions of the affected file. From now on Cryptomator will transparently pass detected conflicts right to the decrypted drive to ensure no version gets lost.
- Several small tweaks and fixes.
