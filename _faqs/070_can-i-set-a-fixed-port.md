title: Can I set a fixed port for the virtual drives?
published: true
abstract: 'Yes you can. Just open Cryptomator and go to the settings dialog.'

To do this click on the gear symbol at the bottom of the vault list.

In this dialog you can set the WebDav port. A value of 0 means that Cryptomator will choose a port automatically. Any other value will set a fixed port. To enable changes here Cryptomator must be restarted.
